# Category Field Removal - SimpliBiz POS

## Changes Made

We've removed the category functionality from the SimpliBiz POS application as requested. The following changes were made:

1. **Product Interface**: Removed `category_id` and `categories` fields from the `Product` interface in `supabase.ts`
   
2. **ProductForm Component**: 
   - Removed category selection dropdown
   - Removed category-related state and handlers
   - Updated form validation to no longer require category
   
3. **Inventory Page**: 
   - Removed category column from product listings
   - Removed category display from product cards
   - Updated ProductForm component usage to no longer pass categories
   
4. **Supabase Integration**:
   - Updated `getProducts` function to no longer request category data
   - Removed `getCategories` and `createCategory` functions as they're no longer needed

## Database Changes Required

A SQL script has been created at `scripts/update-db-schema.sql` that will update your Supabase database schema. To apply these changes:

1. Log in to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of the `update-db-schema.sql` file
4. Execute the script to remove the category_id column from the products table

```sql
-- First remove the foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE products DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS products_category_id_fkey;

-- Then remove the category_id column from the products table
ALTER TABLE products DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS category_id;
```

## Next Steps

After deploying these changes and updating your database schema, the application will operate without any category functionality. If you wish to restore this feature in the future, you will need to revert these changes and re-implement the category selection functionality.
